## ON-Campus Experience
### [Improvement of Object Detection Algorithm YOLOv3](https://coreja.github.io/Schoolwork/2019/05/%E7%89%A9%E4%BD%93%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95YOLOv3%E7%9A%84%E6%94%B9%E8%BF%9B%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/#abstract)  <span>Feb 2019 -- Jun 2019</span>
*Lead author of Thesis for B.E.*

- Conducted the study of feature extraction backbone network `DarkNet-53` and feature interaction network of YOLOv3, and the implementation based on PyTorch
- Proposed improvement ideas concerning the `prior frame` of the model YOLO layer and the network structure of `feature pyramid`. Also proposed improment ideas targeting at training dataset.
- Implemented this improved algorithm with **58.59% mAP** (better than the original one with 35.6% mAP) on BDD100K dataset at the real-time level for detection.

### Internet news classification and recommendation system <span>Mar 2018 -- Aug 2018</span>
*Team Leader*

- Constructed a character-level CNN news classification model 
- Crawled five billion new data and vectorized the text data
- Trained the model and achieving a classification accuracy of 90%
- Designed and developed database, web back-end, and front-end interaction via comprehensive implementation of spring boot, redis and mongoDB
- Fulfilled the system based on big data platform with group and became one of the five National 1st Prize winning groups in the Software Service Outsourcing

### Book recommendation system based on book review content <span>Mar 2018 -- Feb 2019</span>
*Team Leader*

- Pre-processed data regarding text segmentation, de-stopping words, etc.
- Trained tag library word embedding model with word2vec (Chinese Wikipedia corpus)
- Extracted book review keywords using tf-idf and contributed to the design of tag sets and the algorithm calculating correlation between tag sets
- Developed the system “Shu Yun”, applied for an invention patent, and approved as a National level project
- Submitted to the 1st “Big Data Innovation” competition and won the 2nd Class Prize
- Applied for a National Invention Patent (Application No.# 201910109797.1)

### A research on a consumer review utility model <span>Mar 2017 -- Feb 2018</span>
*Team Leader*

- Assumed the Group Leader and coordinated the group’s work throughout the project
- Determined four review evaluation dimensions of timeliness, length, sentiment analysis, and product attributes
- Calculated emotional intensity based on sentiment vocabulary
- Obtained product attributes via training word embedding model with word2vec and extracting top 10 keywords with tf-idf
- Quantified features according to number of feature words and used as input into fuzzy hierarchical comprehensive evaluation model
- Trained model with supervised learning mode and approved as a University-level project
