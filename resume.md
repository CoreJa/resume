***Team Leader* | Georgetown University, U.S. | Advisor: [Ophir Frieder](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~ophir/)**

- Implemented a relational DBMS using `Java` with `Visitor Design Pattern` that supports nearly full `SQL syntax` including `implicit JOIN` and arbitrary expression evaluation for `WHERE` and `UPDATE` conditions
- Implemented full `integrity constraints`, `cost-based` and `rule-based` query optimizations
- Achieved **less than 1 second response** for manipulating 1-million-records table.
- Open source on [Github](https://github.com/CoreJa/ToyDB)

### [the Impact of COVID-19 on people's Travel by Air](https://cosc587.coreja.com/) <span>Aug 2021 -- Dec 2021</span>
***Main Contributor* | Georgetown University, U.S. | Advisor: [Lisa Singh](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/)** 

- Obtained data from [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data), [OpenSky](https://opensky-network.org/), Crawled tweets contains keywords "Covid" and "flight" from Twitter and cleaned all data.
- Tagged randomly selected tweets and performed Sentiment Analysis for tweets text using `VaderSentiment`.
- Performed `SVM`, `random forest` and other 4 classifier on CDC data to test their performance on classification of labeled death rate.
- Designed static front-end web page based on `bootstrap`

### [Improvement of Object Detection Algorithm YOLOv3](https://coreja.github.io/Schoolwork/2019/05/%E7%89%A9%E4%BD%93%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95YOLOv3%E7%9A%84%E6%94%B9%E8%BF%9B%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/#abstract)  <span>Feb 2019 -- Jun 2019</span>
